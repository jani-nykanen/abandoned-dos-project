## An abandoned DOS project

It ran into some technical issues, not to forget that it was boring as hell to play, so I decided to cancel it. I'm going to make another DOS game one day, so this project wasn't in vain.

-----

## Building

Make a new Watcom project (target: 16-bit DOS), put everything there and compile. Should work.

-----

## License:

LGPL could be a good license, I guess. Or just use the code in any way you want, I don't care. Note that the font is a slightly edited version of Commodore 64 font, so I'm not sure of its license (if it has any?).
